##### üëë The Software

In addition to figure out the communication among audio device, EEG headband, TouchDesigner, and ESP32 through UDP and OSC protocol in the past few weeks, I also added vibratiom motor discs and air pump into the circuit. The latter works in the same way as a DC motor that we learned about in Week 4. Below are the circuit and settings in TouchDesigner.

##### üëë The Hardware

I've struggled a bit in the physical fabrication of my prototype. Specifically, how to make sure the vibration motors will stay close to the neck, while the users are able to move freely. My original idea was to 3D print a supporting structure, but realized it was not flexible enough, and it took really long. In the end, I decided to go with laser cutting acrylic sheet to make the structure, and living hinge helped with the flexibility needed.

For the haptic feedback around the head, I used ecoflex-0030 to cast 2 layers of soft silicone sheets, and combined them together with a soft tube I bought from Adafruit. The molds were made from laser cutting acrylic sheets too. It works in the same way as the soft robotics we learnt from the class. Here are some progress photos.

****** Updated in Week 5 ******


##### üßø The Plan

A set of wearables (helmet+vest or necklace+bracelets) that creates multi-sensory (visual, auditory, haptic, and even olfactory) experience through collecting, amplifying, and altering the ambience. The goal is to bring hedonic responses to users, especially those with perceptual impairments such as tone deafness, and to enhance our perceptions and connectivity to the surroundings and ourselves.

<br>
##### üßø The Material List (Developing)

‚óæÔ∏è Microcontrollers: ESP32, Arduino, or maybe I'll need a Raspberry Pi.

‚óæÔ∏è Sensors (Inputs): Microphones, photodiodes, pulse oximeter and heartrate sensor, galvanic skin response sensor, etc.

‚óæÔ∏è Outputs: LEDs, audio player, haptic motors. <i>Also exploring the possibility to incorporate olfactory output.</i>

‚óæÔ∏è Battery: A rechargeable battery will be needed to power the device. The specific type and capacity will depend on the power requirements of the device and to be identified later.

‚óæÔ∏è Wireless module: Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, used to communicate with other devices and transfer data.

‚óæÔ∏è Enclosure: This can be 3D printed, CNC machined, or made from other materials like acrylic or metal.

‚óæÔ∏è Miscellaneous components: Including resistors, capacitors, and wires, etc.

<br>
##### üßø The Timeline

‚óæÔ∏è Week 1 (6-12 Mar): Finalize the design and function of the wearable device, including the logical and intuitive translation of sensory inputs and haptic feedback. Research and order the necessary components and materials.

‚óæÔ∏è Week 2 (13-19 Mar): Assemble the microcontroller and wireless module. Test and calibrate the sensor and output components.

‚óæÔ∏è Week 3 (20-26 Mar): Develop and test the software to process sensor data and generate haptic feedback. Begin testing the integration of the various components.

‚óæÔ∏è Week 4 (27 Mar-2 Apr): Finalize the integration of the components and test the device's basic functionality. Begin developing the machine learning algorithm for adapting to the user's preferences and responses.

‚óæÔ∏è Week 5 (3-9 Apr): Test and refine the machine learning algorithm with user feedback and observations. Start the fabrication of the device enclosure and finalize the decorative elements.

‚óæÔ∏è Week 6 (10-16 Apr): Assemble the final prototype. Conduct additional testing and refine the software and hardware as needed.

‚óæÔ∏è 16 Apr Onwards: Document the design and fabrication process, and prepare the presentation of the device.
