#### <b>Week 8: CNC Milling, Molding & Casting - Durian, Portrait, and Rings</b>
<br>

##### üîñ Assignment 8.1 Description

Design something and make it using CNC.

<br>
##### üîñ ShopBot & Test Cut

As I decided to mill 2D outlines on a plywood, ShopBot is my best option in the makerspace. I learned to operate it during lab and cut a small piece of durian (one of my favorite fruits). This is to familarize myself with cutting & engraving on the machine.

##### üîñ Design

After learning more about CNC milling, I realized the design I had last week was a bit too complicated with too many narrow cuts. So I found another picture and outlined the cutting path. The idea is still to spray paint the surface of the plywood in black, and then reveal the natural color of the wood through milling and form the pattern.

##### üîñ The Cut

Before the usual "voila!", I have to tell you a mistake I made this week. After spray-painting the board (oops forgot to take a picture) and letting it dry, I nailed the plywood onto the CNC table, with 2 plastic nails. Later I learned that I should've used at least 6-8 nails to make sure a proper fastening. The pocketing (engraving) went well. But in the final cuts when the machine was supposed to cut the rectangular shape out, as you might have already predicted, one of the nail got loose due to the vibrations, and the board started moving. I had to stop the milling, cleaned up, and used a scroll saw to finish the final touch.

You may observe one long and deep cut in the final product that wasn't on my outline above. But if anyone ask, it is totally by design ü§´.

And now...... Voila! ‚ú®

##### üíç Assignment 8.2 Description

Create something by molding and casting.

<br>
##### üíç Process

In class, Nathan mentioned that jewelry could be a good option for molding and casting, yet there haven't been many students worked on it. So I decided to making cement rings.

I first modeled 2 rings in Fusion360 and 3D printed them. Fastened each ring to a craft stick with a screw, and also added a straw as an opening for the air to flow in later stage when the casting material will be poured into the mold. I then taped everything to small paper cups, and mixed silicon rubber to create the molds.

The next day, I came back to the lab and the molds were cured. I carefully dismantled the accessories. It was delicate work especially when it comes to cutting the hollowed circle in the middle of the ring, but things went well. I then mixed gypsum cement and poured it into the molds in the cups. The rings were small, the air holes were small, the cement had high viscosity, it was a messy struggle ü´†.

Another day passed, I came back again and found the casting to be a success! The material was soft and sanding was easy. I then decided to melt some metal and cast 2 more metal rings with the same molds. The process was a lot faster as it only took seconds for the metal to set in room temperature, and they turned out to be really cute too. I also love the random texture on the ring created by the excessive metal. Here are some of the process photos.
