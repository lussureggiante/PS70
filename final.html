#### <b>Final Project</b>

<br>
<i>***** This page is being constantly updated. ***** </i>     
<i>***** The plan will be finalized will more design decisions and details next week after a midterm review. *****</i>

<br>
##### 🧿 The Plan

A set of wearables (helmet+vest or necklace+bracelets) that creates multi-sensory (visual, auditory, haptic, and even olfactory) experience through collecting, amplifying, and altering the ambience. The goal is to bring hedonic responses to users, especially those with perceptual impairments such as tone deafness, and to enhance our perceptions and connectivity to the surroundings and ourselves. Some possible forms generated by DALL-E below.

<br>
##### 🧿 The Material List (Developing)

◾️ Microcontrollers: ESP32, Arduino, or maybe I'll need a Raspberry Pi.

◾️ Sensors (Inputs): Microphones, photodiodes, pulse oximeter and heartrate sensor, galvanic skin response sensor, etc.

◾️ Outputs: LEDs, audio player, haptic motors. <i>Also exploring the possibility to incorporate olfactory output.</i>

◾️ Battery: A rechargeable battery will be needed to power the device. The specific type and capacity will depend on the power requirements of the device and to be identified later.

◾️ Wireless module: Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, used to communicate with other devices and transfer data.

◾️ Enclosure: This can be 3D printed, CNC machined, or made from other materials like acrylic or metal.

◾️ Miscellaneous components: Including resistors, capacitors, and wires, etc.

<br>
##### 🧿 The Timeline

◾️ Week 1 (6-12 Mar): Finalize the design and function of the wearable device, including the logical and intuitive translation of sensory inputs and haptic feedback. Research and order the necessary components and materials.

◾️ Week 2 (13-19 Mar): Assemble the microcontroller and wireless module. Test and calibrate the sensor and output components.

◾️ Week 3 (20-26 Mar): Develop and test the software to process sensor data and generate haptic feedback. Begin testing the integration of the various components.

◾️ Week 4 (27 Mar-2 Apr): Finalize the integration of the components and test the device's basic functionality. Begin developing the machine learning algorithm for adapting to the user's preferences and responses.

◾️ Week 5 (3-9 Apr): Test and refine the machine learning algorithm with user feedback and observations. Start the fabrication of the device enclosure and finalize the decorative elements.

◾️ Week 6 (10-16 Apr): Assemble the final prototype. Conduct additional testing and refine the software and hardware as needed.

◾️ 16 Apr Onwards: Document the design and fabrication process, and prepare a demonstration or presentation of the device.
