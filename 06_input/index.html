#### <b>Week 6: Electronic Input Devices - Capacitive Sensor & Microphone</b>
<br>

##### üéõÔ∏è Assignment 6 Description

Make a capacitive sensor to measure a physical quantity with your microcontroller. Avoid the delay() function; use timers instead. Select another sensor. Include schematics of each sensor. Calibrate each sensor by plotting points on a graph. Discuss the relationship between the signals recorded by your microcontroller and the physical quantities that you're measuring.

##### üéõÔ∏è Capacitive Sensor

This week, we learnt to make capacitive sensors. They could be used to measure distance, weight, water level, etc. I used the transmit-receive method, or tx-rx method, to make a sensor to measure the distance between two pieces of copper foil tape. To make the calibration easier, I tapped them on tiny paper boxes so that I could get more steady readings from the arduino serial plotter. And I measured the distance with a ruler, although it would be better if I did the measurement with a caliper. Here are some process photos and the result. From the plot we can see the relationship between the distance and the reading is exponential delay.

##### üéõÔ∏è Adafruit MEMS Microphone Breakout SPW2430

For the second sensor, I experimented with the microphone, as I planned to include it in my final project. I managed to measure the alert volume of my laptop. In the future, I would like to measure the frequency of ambient sound as well. I tried but failed on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) this week ü•≤. From the plot we can see the relationship between the volume and the reading is linear growth.
