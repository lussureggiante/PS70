#### <b>Week 5: 3D Design & Printing - Print in Place & Polycam</b>
<br>

##### ü™¢ Assignment 5.1 Description

Design and print a small object that could not be (easily) made by subtractive methods.

<br>
##### ü™¢ Inspiration

I have some 3d printing experience prior to this class, most of them done in the new makerspace at SEC that we visited this week. There, I remembered seeing a very cute and fun articulated lizard printed by some mysterious 3d design master (that was my assumption). I was fascinated by it and always wanted to learn how to print something like that (but never acted on it apparently ü´£). Below is one example of the same design I found on Esty.

##### ü™¢ Process

This week, through reading, I learned that that was a technique called print-in-place, and it was not rocket science! Therefore, I decided to design and print something of my own through print-in-place. After a few iterations in Fusion 360, I've landed on a bracelet design. I've also adjusted the orientation of the beads for optimized 3d printing.

##### üçä Assignment 5.2 Description

Scan something using a photogrammetry, LIDAR, or other application.

<br>
##### üçä A Buddha's Hand

The RevoPoint 3D Scanner in the lab is faulty this week. So I tried a free photogrammetry APP available on iPhone: Pilycam. The APP gives 5 free trials. For reasons that I'm still unsure of, my first several scans failed. I did the scans at my desk in Gund, on which there was a cutting mat, I guess the complicated pattern on the cutting mat might have affected the 3D capture. Anyway, I tried one last time at home with a dried buddha's hand (a variety of cirtus), and to my surprise, it succeeded! Here're the results.
