#### <b>Week 3: Kinetic Sculpture - Jansen's Walker</b>
<br>

##### ðŸ¦¿ Assignment 3 Description

Create a kinetic sculpture. Include circuitry to move your sculpture.
Control the sculpture with a circuit on a breadboard that uses components in the lab.

<br>
##### ðŸ¦¿ Inspiration

My inspiration comes from the strandbeests made by Theo Jansen. I'm actually taking Chuck Hoberman's (the inventor of Hoberman sphere as introduced by Nathan this week!) Informal Robotics this term, and he covered the leg system by Jansen briefly in the class too. I was fascinated by it, and would like to make my own set in order to fully understand this system. I hoped it could also be used to demonstrate how Jansen's leg system worked more clearly to my peers.

##### ðŸ¦¿ Process & Iterations

I modeled the components in Fusion 360 based on the dimensions I found on the internet and made a few modifications through prototyping. I started with cardboards, iterated and evoluted to a working model, and cut my final model with acrylc boards. The sculpture was then assembled with split pins and straws, and connected to a motor powered by an Arduino board. Here are photos of some of the interations and the final kinetic sculpture.

The supporting structure of the walker is a bit shaky. I made it out of the acrylic board I used to cut the main compomnents, as I didn't want to waste too much material on it. This is the part that I would like to improve in my future projects.
