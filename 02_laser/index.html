#### <b> Week 2: Laser Cutting - Making a Lantern</b>
<br>

##### 🏮 Assignment Description

Create a press-fit construction kit that can be assembled in multiple ways, and accounts for lasercutter kerf. Expect to make multiple trips to the laser cutter, as pieces often won't fit together perfectly the first time.

<br>

##### 🏮 Inspiration

The idea of making a lantern came from the traditional Lantern Festival which fell on last Sunday (Feb 5th). Additional aesthetic references were from Olafur Eliasson's installations.

##### 🏮 Design

Here are a few renders to illustrate the design I have in mind. The ideal material for this lantern would be arylic sheets.

These elements can be assembled in various ways to form interesting shapes.

##### 🏮 Modeling

I made 3d models of the components needed to assemble a simple lantern in Fusion 360, and projected 2d drawings for laser cutting. The dimensions were adjusted based on the measurement of the cardboard that would be used in actual fabrication.
