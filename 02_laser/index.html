#### <b> Week 2: Laser Cutting - Making a Lantern (and Some 3D Modeling)</b>
<br>

##### 🏮 Assignment 2.1 Description

Create a press-fit construction kit that can be assembled in multiple ways, and accounts for lasercutter kerf. Expect to make multiple trips to the laser cutter, as pieces often won't fit together perfectly the first time.

<br>

##### 🏮 Inspiration

The idea of making a lantern came from the traditional Lantern Festival which fell on last Sunday (Feb 5th). Additional aesthetic references were from Olafur Eliasson's installations.

##### 🏮 Design

Here are a few renders to illustrate the design I have in mind. The ideal material for this lantern would be arylic sheets.

These elements can be assembled in various ways to form interesting shapes.

##### 🏮 Modeling

I made 3d models of the components needed to assemble a simple lantern in Fusion 360, and projected 2d drawings for laser cutting. The dimensions were adjusted based on the measurement of the cardboard that would be used in actual fabrication.

##### 📐 Assignment 2.2 & 2.3 Description

Work through a Fusion 360 tutorial and document what you produce.
Select at least 2 household objects or components from the lab (could be items you think you might include in your final project). Measure them using calipers, and model them in Fusion 360 (or other program). 

<br>

##### 📐 Learning & Using Fusion 360

I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzSaIl_-68g" target="_blank"> this tutorial</a> to learn to create a bended object, and made a model of a fork.
Then I found 2 household items that I thought would be interesting to model: a wine bottle and a sunblock tube.

And... a reveal of how they actually look like in real life on my desk. ✨
